
This is a 3x3 light squares with a tilt-a-whirl.  The intent of this project was just to have a bit of fun and keep myself occupied while the family watched the 2014 November soccer game.  

I saw a project on my feed that showed color squares.  It looked pretty neat and I decided to try my own version of the same project.  Products used:

The light source:
  9 Neopixels - https://www.adafruit.com/products/1461 
  $3.75

The breadboard:
  Solderable mini breadboard - https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12702 - 
  $2.95

Main processor
  Arduino Pro mini - https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11113
  $9.95
  I would have used an AT Tiny, in the form of an Adafruit Trinket, since it is cheaper, but 
  this project required the 32k memory of the full Atmega328.  

Input
  Tilt-A-Whirl

  I was going to go with buttons, then with a capacitive touch sensor, but since
  this was going to sit on a desk I really thought that being able to flip the box would
  be a fun way of changing the state.  

This build is a 3x3 pixel grid with some really nice colors.  I used the orientation of the entire installation to decide the specific state of the project.  If you flip the project onto its sides then the tilt-a-whirl will choose a new state.

Including here the enclosure that I used for both the lights as well as the electronics.
